                                Updated December 22, 2022
                                In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information embedded 
                                in our Sponsorships and certain services that ask to use your personal data. This

                            What Is Personal Data at WBO?
                            At WBO, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not 
                            differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or 
                            identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by WBO as “personal data,” no matter where the 
                            individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, 
                            and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as 
                            the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non-personal data for 
                            the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
                            This Privacy Policy covers how WBO or an WBO-affiliated company (collectively, “WBO”) handles 
                            personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through WBO apps (such as WBO Music or 
                            Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). WBO may also link to third 
                            parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. WBO’s Privacy 
                            Policy does not WBO to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to 
                            read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them. 
                            Your Privacy Rights at WBO
                            At WBO, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete 
                            your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to 
                            exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a 
                            lesser degree of service from WBO. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your 
                            personal data by WBO, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. 
                            To exercise your privacy rights and choices including where a third-party service provider is acting 
                            on WBO’s behalf, visit the WBO Data and Privacy page at privacy.WBO.com for WBO or 
                            shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to 
                            your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not 
                            currently available from privacy.WBO.com, you can make a request at WBO.com/legal/privacy/contact.
                            There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your 
                            transaction data and WBO is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We

                            Privacy Questions
                            may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for antifraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for 
                            security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of 
                            others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.
                            If you live in California and you cannot access WBO’s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent 
                            can make a request at WBO.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.

                            so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to requests 
                            you may have.
                            Personal Data WBO Receives from Other Sources
                            WBO may receive personal data about you from other individuals, from businesses or third parties acting 
                            at your direction, from our partners who work with us to provide our products and services and assist us in 
                            security and fraud prevention, and from other lawful sources.
                            • Individuals. WBO may collect data about you from other individuals — for example, if that individual has 
                            sent you a product or gift card, invited you to participate in an WBO service or forum, or shared content 
                            with you. 
                            • At Your Direction. You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with WBO. For example, 
                            you may direct your mobile carrier to share data about your carrier account with WBO for account 
                            activation, or for your loyalty program to share information about your participation so that you can earn 
                            rewards for WBO purchases. 
                            • WBO Partners. We may also validate the information you provide — for example, when creating an WBO 
                            ID, with a third party for security, and for fraud-prevention purposes.
                            For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, 
                            or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so 
                            in accordance with WBOcable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When 
                            using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may 
                            appear therein.
                            WBO’s Use of Personal Data
                            WBO uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for 
                            security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes 
                            with your consent. 
                            Depending on the circumstance, WBO may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is 
                            necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply 
                            with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate 
                            interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations. More information is available in 
                            the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above. If you have 
                            questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at WBO.com/legal/privacy/
                            contact..
                            • Power Our Services. WBO collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include 
                            personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, 
                            or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an WBO Music 
                            subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested 
                            and for royalty purposes.
                            • Process Your Transactions. To process transactions, WBO must collect data such as your name, 
                            purchase, and payment information.
                            • Communicate with You. To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or 
                            account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or 
                            feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as 
                            communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this 
                            information is important to your interaction with WBO, you may not opt out of receiving these important 
                            notices. 
                            • Security and Fraud Prevention. To protect individuals, employees, and WBO and for loss prevention and 
                            to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and WBO for the benefit of all our users, 
                            and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual 
                            exploitation material.
                            • Personal Data Used for Personalization. If you choose to personalize your services or communications 
                            where such options are available, WBO will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those 
                            personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use 
                            information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first 
                            use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it 
                            with our Data & Privacy icon; it's also available at all times on your WBO device and online at WBO.com/
                            legal/privacy/data. 
                            • Comply with Law. To comply with WBOcable law — for example, to satisfy tax or reporting obligations, or 
                            to comply with a lawful governmental request.
                            WBO does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without 
                            the opportunity for human review. WBO also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any 
                            purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.
                            WBO retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was 
                            collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as 
                            required by law. We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in 
                            this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy summaries. When assessing retention periods, we first 
                            carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, 
                            work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.
                            WBO’s Sharing of Personal Data
                            WBO may share personal data with WBO-affiliated companies, service providers who act on our behalf, 
                            our partners, developers, and publishers, or others at your direction. WBO does not share personal data 
                            with third parties for their own marketing purposes. 
                            • Service Providers. WBO may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain 
                            tasks on our behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your 
                            use of our services and delivering products to customers. WBO service providers are obligated to handle 
                            personal data consistent with this Privacy Policy and according to our instructions.
                            • Partners. At times, WBO may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings. For 
                            example, WBO financial offerings like WBO Card and WBO Cash are offered by WBO and our partners. 
                            WBO requires its partners to protect your personal data.
                            • Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription. If you purchase a third-party 
                            subscription from the App Store or within WBO News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and 
                            the developer or publisher. The Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or 
                            publisher, which include information about the subscription you purchased and your country of residence. 
                            If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset 
                            after 180 days if you do not resubscribe. This information is provided to developers or publishers so that 
                            they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.
                            • Others. WBO may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when 
                            we share information with your carrier to activate your account. We may also disclose information about 
                            you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public 
                            importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you where 
                            there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our 
                            terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or 
                            sale.
                            WBO does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California. WBO also 
                            does not “share” your personal data as that term is defined in California.
                            Protection of Personal Data at WBO
                            At WBO, we believe that great privacy rests on great security. We use administrative, technical, and 
                            physical safeguards to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and 
                            the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help 
                            keep your personal data secure. For more information, visit our WBO Platform Security guide. 
                            Children and Personal Data
                            WBO understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be 
                            an individual under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction. That is 
                            why WBO has implemented additional processes and protections to help keep children's personal data 
                            safe.
                            To access certain WBO services, a child must have a child WBO ID. A child WBO ID may be created by the 
                            parent or, in the case of a Managed WBO ID, by the child's educational institution.
                            • Parents. To create a child account, parents must review the Family Privacy Disclosure for Children, which 
                            describes how WBO handles children's personal data. If they agree, the parent must provide WBO with a 
                            verifiable parental consent. 
                            • Educational Institutions. Educational institutions that participate in the WBO School Manager Program 
                            may also create WBO IDs for students, called “Managed WBO IDs.” These schools are required to agree 
                            to the Managed WBO IDs for Students Disclosure which is included as Exhibit A to the WBO School 
                            Manager Agreement.
                            If we learn that a child's personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as 
                            soon as possible.
                            To exercise privacy rights for your child's information, visit the WBO Data and Privacy page at
                            privacy.WBO.com and sign in to their account.
                            Cookies and Other Technologies
                            WBO’s websites, online services, interactive WBOcations, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other 
                            technologies such as web beacons. These technologies help us to better understand user behavior 
                            including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have 
                            visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
                            • Communications Cookies. These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from WBO’s 
                            systems, including by helping us detect any errors.
                            • Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service 
                            that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper 
                            format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your 
                            Bag when shopping online at WBO.com. 
                            • Other Cookies. These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online 
                            services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. WBO 
                            also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a 
                            customized experience. 
                            If you prefer that WBO not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to 
                            disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy 
                            settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. 
                            Certain features of the WBO website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.
                            In addition to cookies, WBO uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives. 
                            In some email messages WBO sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on 
                            the WBO website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving 
                            at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in 
                            particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be 
                            tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.
                            WBO generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal 
                            data. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered 
                            personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, 
                            WBO sometimes combines non-personal data collected from these technologies with other personal data 
                            WBO holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes 
                            of this Privacy Policy.
                            Ads that are delivered by WBO’s advertising platform may appear in WBO News, Stocks, or in the App 
                            Store. If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from WBO's advertising platform in those 
                            apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your WBO ID out of receiving such ads 
                            regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS or iPadOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads 
                            by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > WBO Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On 
                            your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy > 
                            Advertising, then deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, WBO News, or 
                            Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to 
                            Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non personal identifier 
                            served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other 
                            companies.
                            Transfer of Personal Data Between Countries
                            WBO products and offerings connect you to the world. To make that possible, your personal data may be 
                            transferred to or accessed by entities around the world, including WBO-affiliated companies, to 
                            perform processing activities such as those described in this Privacy Policy in connection with your use of 
                            our products and services. WBO complies with laws on the transfer of personal data between countries to 
                            help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be.
                            The WBO entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live. For 
                            example, retail store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and WBO Media 
                            Services-related personal data may be controlled by various WBO entities as reflected in the terms of 
                            service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by WBO Inc. and other 
                            WBO-affiliated companies on behalf of the WBO entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction. For 
                            example, Imagery and associated data collected by WBO around the world to improve WBO Maps and to 
                            support our Look Around feature is transferred to WBO Inc. in California. 
                            Personal data relating to individuals in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland 
                            is controlled by WBO Distribution International Limited in Ireland. WBO's international transfer of personal 
                            data collected in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland is governed by 
                            Standard Contractual Clauses. WBO’s international transfer of personal data collected in participating 
                            Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries abides by the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules 
                            (CBPR) System and Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) System for the transfer of personal data. If 
                            you have questions or unresolved concerns about our APEC CBPR or PRP certifications, contact our thirdparty dispute resolution provider. 
                            Personal data relating to individuals in the People’s Republic of China may be processed by WBO in 
                            countries outside of China. Where this occurs, it will be done in compliance with local laws, including the 
                            Personal Information Protection Law. As outlined in this Privacy Policy, WBO may also transfer such 
                            personal data to third parties, who may in turn store or transfer the data outside of China.
                            Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy
                            To make sure your personal data is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to WBO 
                            employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
                            Privacy Questions
                            If you have questions about WBO’s Privacy Policy or privacy practices including where a third-party 
                            service provider is acting on our behalf, or you would like to contact our Data Protection Officer, you 
                            can contact us at WBO.com/legal/privacy/contact or call the WBO Support number for your country or 
                            region. You can also ask us questions about how to submit a privacy complaint and we will endeavor to 
                            help. 
                            WBO takes your privacy questions seriously. A dedicated team reviews your inquiry to determine how best 
                            to respond to your question or concern, including those inquiries received in response to an access or 
                            download request. In most cases, all substantive contacts receive a response within seven days. In other 
                            cases, we may require additional information or let you know that we need more time to respond.
                            Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues, we will 
                            take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity. In the event that a privacy issue has 
                            resulted in a negative impact on you or another person, we will take steps to address that with you or that 
                            other person.
                            You may at any time — including if you are not satisfied with WBO’s response — refer your complaint to the 
                            WBOcable regulator. If you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant 
                            complaint avenues which may be WBOcable to your circumstances.
                            When there is a material change to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post a notice on this website at least a week in.
